## Audit log
| Date | Actor | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| 2026-08-03 | scaffold-script | Stub created from PPBF_CAPABILITIES.json |
| 2026-08-15 | wave9-reconciliation | Reconciliation audit: PARTIAL coverage — Blank DRAFT stub, Active=false, no defined intent/tables/roles. Missing: A tested readiness-score formula exists and UI scaffolding to display it exists, but they are not wired together: no API route persists or serves per-. Evidence: docs/capabilities/modules/169-readiness-dashboard.md; apps/web/src/server/pilot/readinessMath.ts. Status stays DRAFT. |
