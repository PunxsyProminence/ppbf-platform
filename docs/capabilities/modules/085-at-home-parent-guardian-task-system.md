| 2026-08-03 | wave5-ps | Wave 5 batch DONE in tracker |
| 2026-08-28 | owner (Jason Neale) | Manual verification signed off. ONE BLANKET SIGN-OFF covering all 47 modules that carried PENDING_SIGN_OFF, given by the owner on this date -- NOT 47 separate inspections, and this line says so on purpose. What it records is the owner's acceptance of the slices as built; it is not a statement that each module was individually re-verified against the running app, and it does not change `Active`, which stays false. At the time of signing, 59 of the 94 modules claiming DONE cited no checkable path into the codebase -- the capability evidence guard in the web test suite measures that and stops it growing -- deliberately named here without a path, because this note would otherwise read as a citation to the very tooling that counts citations, and make 47 modules look evidenced by their own sign-off line. |
