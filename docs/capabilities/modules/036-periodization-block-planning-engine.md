_One paragraph: what this module owns and what it must never do._

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Data model / tables named
- [ ] API surface listed (or explicitly none)

- [ ] Safety / refusal cases
- [ ] Audit events
- [ ] UI surface or "API-only"

## Implementation notes
_Scaffold only. Do not mark active until promotion review._

## Audit log
| Date | Actor | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| 2026-08-03 | scaffold-script | Stub created from PPBF_CAPABILITIES.json |
| 2026-08-28 | foundation slice | `pilot.athlete_development_blocks` shipped: the coach-authored plan record the engine-unlock proposal found missing. Parent planning object only — no objectives, no comparison surface, no API, no UI. Status stays **DRAFT** and Active stays **false**; a parent table is not a module. See the proposal's "Implementation status" section. |
