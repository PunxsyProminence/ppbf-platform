## Audit log
| Date | Actor | Note |
|------|-------|------|
| 2026-08-03 | scaffold-script | Stub created from PPBF_CAPABILITIES.json |
| 2026-08-15 | wave9-reconciliation | Reconciliation audit: PARTIAL coverage — coach-role SHADOW chat adapter (AI Q&A for coaches), no bespoke intelligence/recommendation engine. Missing: no dedicated coach-intelligence data model/decision engine distinct from generic SHADOW chat. Evidence: apps/web/app/api/pilot/coach/chat/route.ts; apps/web/app/api/pilot/coach/chat/route.test.ts. Status stays DRAFT. |
